# software-testing-in-UU
This repository contains the work done by our group for the Software Testing course in Uppsala University. 
The project focuses on applying white-box and black-box testing methodologies to a software that utilizes the Python Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.

## Project Overview
In this project, we tested a software system that uses Pandas to process data, focusing on:

- White-box testing: We examined the internal workings of the system, focusing on how the Pandas functions were used to manipulate data.
- Black-box testing: We tested the software from an end-user perspective, ensuring the system's outputs matched expectations based on input data, without knowledge of the internal workings.
